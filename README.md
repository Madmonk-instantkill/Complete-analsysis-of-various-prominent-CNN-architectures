# Complete-analsysis-of-various-prominent-CNN-architectures


The aim of this project is understand how CNN modules work.  Here we aim to examine 3 different ( in fact most prominent CNN architects that are used). They are :
1. VGG-16
2. Resnet_50
3.Inception_V4

We then tried to check the performance  of these three models by varying the optimizers, We used the most prominent optimizers that deep learning has to offer ie Adam and RMS. We even used the various regularization techniques like Batchnorm and dropout.Though Batch norm is moslty used for optimization, we can use it for providing some bit of regulaization . Also we kept changing the activation functions  from relu to leaky relu or tanh etc

The data set used was CIFAR100
